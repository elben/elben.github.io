title: "Introduction"

I’m writing from a desolate *backpackers* lodge in Franschhoek, a small town in the wine-producing region of South Africa. It’s the dark of night, with the wind howling across the farmlands as pounding rain pelts our roof. The fire is almost too hot, its wet wood crackling and popping, shifting unevenly in the blackened hearth. We had been traveling for a month now, a few weeks in Europe and now in South Africa. And in the worsening rain, bunkered in for the night with nothing to do, I began to write.

Sometimes I find travel writing perplexing. Other genres have neat themes and stories, but what of travel writing? Maybe the author has some inner turmoil that develops as she travels the land, concluding in some epiphany or serenity. Or maybe you find social or political themes that tie all the various places and peoples together, memorialized in a final sentence. And if distilled in social media, your travel is but an account of various locations, with a photo of a cheery smile or excited front, regardless of your actual condition—a regurgitation of snapshots for the pleasure and envy your friends.

But I write selfishly—it’s therapeutic, it’s organizational, it’s reflection cut into discrete sentences. And sitting here, alone in the lodge (Kristina napping) with one wall opened to the vineyards, I write because the heart of travel is not found front of the grand vista or staring into the eyes of a leopard, but in the sublime quietness that follows, in the memories, in the reflection. In my travel there is rarely a shattering self-discovery, or a decisive moment, or an original insight. It is rather the slow build-up of memories and ideas—the recall of a conversation with a stranger, or a sharp observation from a local, a bowl of soup, the unexpected vista—that I prefer to keep from my travel, the discovery of things precious only to me.

This writing, then, is a gift that you are not compelled to take home. It is an account, as true as I can be, of our travel. It is chronological, but not necessarily comprehensive. There is no need for me to describe a visit to the Eiffel tower. But what I include are events, conversations and observations that I felt to be important. This begs the question, important to whom? Well, to be frank, important to me. But important in what sense? In the sense that it sparked a pause in my mind, that it warranted me jot down the conversation, to remember a particular emotion, a particular color of the sky. Some of these things I write about, I believe, speak to the human condition. But some are purely aesthetic, or entertaining. Again, this is but a small gift. Primarily, of course, to myself.
