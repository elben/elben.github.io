# TODO

- [ ] Look at [hakyll-convert](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hakyll-convert),

- [ ] Post URLs should be exact same as before (SEO).

      Like:
      /blog/utf8-for-jruby-and-mysql/

      Not:
      /posts/2014-07-22-utf8-for-jruby-and-mysql.html

      Or, use /posts (but fix file name) and set up re-direct files (via head) from /blog.

      - [x] Figure out how to make like /blog/utf8-for-jruby-and-mysql/
      - [ ] Links to blog posts should NOT include the .html at the end.

- [ ] clojure atom feed equivalent.

# DONE
