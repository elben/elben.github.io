What is the reason for art? What can we learn from philosophy, from stories?

If art does not console us, if philosophy does not teach us, if stories do not change us, then what are they for?

I think as programmers, we can learn a whole lot from these things. Not just on how to be wiser people, but apply it in our day-to-day at the office and with our work. For that, I will walk us along three pieces: a painting, a philosophical thought experiment, and a story.

# The Milkmaid

This is *The Milkmaid* by Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer:

You may have seen this painting before—it’s considered one of the great Dutch paintings.

What do you feel? Maybe warmth, or peace? Perhaps a sense of solitude, a steadfastness.

Here is an ordinary peasant pouring milk. The simplest of morning tasks. But look at her! Look at her peace, her pride, her poise. She is satisfied by what she is doing. She is, as is popular to say today, “in the flow.”

She is satisfied in the work itself, not because she has a boss to please, not for likes or congratulations. Vermeer surely didn’t do it for up votes or Reddit gold; he died poor and his paintings were considered worthless for 200 years.

But have you ever wondered why Vermeer bothered to paint such an ordinary woman doing such an ordinary task? Surely he should have spent the the hours on grander projects that would have pleased the people and brought wealth and fame. So why did he paint this?

Because he wanted to show us something.

He wanted to show that a person’s work, however small or humble, has an intrinsic value greater than what we may see, greater than what the markets pays her.

Vermeer tells us that whatever work we do, however minute or hidden, in valuable in itself, and that its value is derived not just based of how much “utility” it brings into society, but because of the person doing the work.

That is, we can value people’s work because they are a person, and not based off social hierarchy or utility.

I’m prone to judge people by their work, and perhaps you find this fault in you too. But Vermeer teaches us to undo this. As I back-end programmer, I can learn to value the work of the front-end, and vice-versa. We can learn to see the intrinsic value of the work done by our PMs, our managers, our sales team, our marketing team.

If we can learn to do that, then we have learned from Vermeer.

# Allegory of the Cave

In Plato’s *Allegory of the Cave*, we have a thought experiment.

<img src="/images/art-philosophy-stories/Plato_Allegory_of_the_Cave.jpg" title="Plato’s Cave">

You are a prisoner chained in a dark cave since birth. You face a wall, and the guards cast shadows of puppets on the wall with fire. The sounds from the guards echo off the wall, making you believe that the shadows are alive.

After decades of imprisonment and watching the living, talking shadows, the guards release you. You turn around and the light of the fire blind your eyes, and the shadows disappear. You are then brought into the day at noon, where there are no shadows. Would you prefer this new world, or the old?

Plato believed that this prisoner would hate the new world, for all he knew was the cave and the shadows. The true reality, to him, is false; and he would prefer to retreat to the cave.

But say the sun begins to set, and to learn how the light casts shadows on objects. You realize those shadows were but an illusion. You begin, in other words, to *understand from first principles* of how things worked.

From this, I wonder if we all have our caves: ideas and assumptions that we run from because we much prefer what we *feel* and *prefer* to be true. We hate the sun not because of the sun, but because of our ignorance and fear.

But if we observe and think from first principles, if we examine how the shadows are created, if we begin to think not in terms of what we’d prefer, either to protect or promote ourselves, but desiring truth above safety, then we are learning to leave our caves.

In programming, ideas are thrown around us all the time. We learn to put filters and make quick judgements on what is good and bad. I think that’s often necessary; none of us have the time to thoroughly examine every new thing on Hacker News. But I wonder if we often miss out because we prefer the shadows to the real thing.

There are two ways we can be at fault here.

First, can we be too quick to accept the next new framework/language as the next-best-thing ever, simply because everyone else is saying it. We use it because everyone else is doing it, instead of actually understanding why it’s good, or how it’s built.

I hate database websites. They promise all three of CAP or whatever, and globally scalable, yet I say: show me the meat. I don’t remember who said this, but I remember the idea: I don’t want the UML diagrams. Just tell me the table schemas and I will understand the rest.

We must learn to understand from first principles, from the buildings blocks themselves. We see the tricks behind the flash and bang. We must get away from the marketing page, and look for the meaty documentation. Often we’ll need to read the source code.

On the other hand, we can be too quick to dismiss ideas as bad without giving it a thought. This too is a problem: you’ll be stuck in your ancient ways (hey, there are many ancient things that are wonderful and should not be changed; see Vermeer and Plato) and miss out on new advances.

If we have learned from Plato, then our answer is not to readily accept everything as truth, nor to dismiss everything as false. Instead, we must learn to examine critically from the building blocks. That is, we must understand.

## The return to the cave

In Plato’s cave, you, the prisoner, eventually go back into the cave. Not because you prefer the chains, but because you pity the other prisoners and want to get them out. But having been accustomed to the light, you would stumble blind into the cave. The other prisoners see that the outside world has blinded you, would now, according to Plato, refuse to leave.

What we can take away from this is *how* we communicate new ideas is important.

I will use Elixir as an example, because it’s been #1 on HN for 30 days straight and has been the talk of many of my co-workers. Say you’re convinced Elixir is the next best thing. Well, I will not believe you, because I like my languages. And I have better things to do. What convinces would not be, “hey check out this blog post just 10 lines of Elixir for a Slack clone with 2 billion concurrent connections. And if things fail you just don’t worry and it auto-restarts and hypervisor and it works great. And WhatsApp uses Elixir they have 8 billion users last I check. OK, not Elixir but you get the idea.”

That is the argument of the stumbling, blind man trying to save his fellow prisoners. They would rather die in the cave. What the other prisoners need is a demonstration of how the shadows are created.

I want to understand from how it works, how it compare to other runtimes, how the Erlang scheduler works, and what “10 trillion threads” actually mean. I want to know what new problems may arise, what the tradeoffs are.

Of course, I say this with a catch. Sometimes you do need the trailblazers that goes for it. But for the most part, for our day-to-day in our profession, I want the shadow demonstration.

# The eleven dwarves and the feast (The Last Battle by CS Lewis)

- After a great battle between the King of Narnia and his friends, and the worshippers of Tash, a demon. The noble Narnians have lost the battle, and are thrown into a stable, where they think the demon Tash awaits to devour them.
- They find, however, that they are in a beautiful country, greener than anything they’ve ever seen, sweeter smelling than anything they’ve ever seen. They are in Aslan’s country, the allegorical heaven in this story. And if you know CS Lewis, Aslan is a benevolent lion, who is an allegory of Jesus Christ.
- With them are eleven dwarfs, who were also thrown in. They’re cranky. They were against both sides. But they think they are still in the dark stable, and they are blind to the sights.

The Dwarfs had a very odd look. They weren’t strolling about or enjoying themselves. They were sitting very close together in a little circle facing one another.

“Dearest,” said Aslan (to his friends), “I will show you both what I can, and what I cannot do.” He came close to the Dwarfs and gave a low growl: low, but it set all the air shaking. But the Dwarfs said to one another, “Hear that? That’s the gang at the other end. Trying to frighten us. They do it with a machine of some kind. Don’t take any notice."

Aslan raised his head and shook his mane. Instantly a glorious feast appears on the Dwarfs’ knees: pies and tongues and pigeons and truffles and ices, and each Dwarf had a goblet of good wine in his right hand. But it wasn’t much use. They began eating and drinking greedily enough, but it was clear that they couldn’t taste it properly. One said he was trying to eat hay and another said he had got a bit of an old turnip and a third said he’d found a raw cabbage leaf. And they raised the golden goblets of rich red wine to their lips and said “Ugh! Fancy drinking water out of a trough that a donkey’s been at!"

But very soon every Dwarf began suspecting that every other Dwarf had found something nicer than he had, and they started grabbing and snatching, and went on to quarreling, till in a few minutes there was a free fight and all the good food was smeared on their faces and clothes.

“You see,” said Aslan. “They will not let us help them. They have chosen cunning instead of belief. Their prison is only in their own minds, yet they are in that prison."

- This is a similar retention of Plato’s cave. You see how these ideas play around across the centuries.
- In my life, I think of all the times that I have been in very beautiful places, an exotic locale, or at some Michellene restaurant, but I’m too angry or bitter after fighting with my wife to enjoy it. You all know what I mean.
- Or of all the blessings I have, not because I deserve it or am special, but just because it has been gifted to me, freely. Just like Aslan has given the dwarfs this delicious feast. Yet I am always looking for the next better thing, and I’m blinded by what’s right in front of me.
- I think as programmers, one thing many of us have to fight is an urge to tear down any new ideas as bad. We haven’t given it five seconds of thought and have concluded it’s bad, for whatever reason. In those moments we are the dwarfes, who were at the footsteps of heaven, if only they would open their eyes! If only they would think less about themselves, and try to see what everyone else is telling them.
- Second, notice how Aslan is trying to help them. He gives them a feast, but they are too worried about themselves. And maybe a co-worker gives me an idea. That is out of their care for me, for our product, for the company. I don’t mean all ideas are good, because many are bad. But a co-worker has spent the time thinking of it, and communicating it. They do it because they care. The least we can do is also care.

- I hope I don’t sound like I’m lecturing. I’d rather let CS Lewis and Plato and Vermeer lecture. We can all learn from them. Thank you.
