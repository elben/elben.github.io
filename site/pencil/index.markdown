Pencil is a static site generator written in Haskell.

With Pencil, you write Haskell code to generate your website from source files
(HTML, CSS, Markdown). Pencil comes pre-loaded with blogging, tagging,
templating, and Markdown and Sass/Scss. And it's flexible enough to extend for
your own needs.

This website itself is generated via Pencil. You can view the source code
